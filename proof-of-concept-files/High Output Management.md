# 5 key indicators we can use to measure people
These are taken from manufacturing but we can adapt to people management, I want to adapt them to product management

| Manufacturing | PM Translation | PM Metric |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Daily output forecast | What do we still need to accomplish this sprint? | Story points remaining |
| Inventory levels | What has been done so far? | Story points completed |
| Condition of Equipment | Blockers? | Story points blocked |
| Update on workforce | Human capacity? | People available |
| Output quality | What's the quality of what's been done so far? | Bugs reported in builds |

Can combine these things to get insight
