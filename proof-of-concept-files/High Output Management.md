# 5 key indicators we can use to measure people
These are taken from manufacturing but we can adapt to people management, I want to adapt them to product management

| Manufacturing | PM Translation | PM Metric |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Daily output forecast | What do we still need to accomplish this sprint? | Story points remaining |
| Inventory levels | What has been done so far? | Story points completed |
| Condition of Equipment | Blockers? | Story points blocked |
| Update on workforce | Human capacity? | People available |
| Output quality | What's the quality of what's been done so far? | Bugs reported in builds |
Can combine these things to get insight

# Types of activities managers can do:
- Decision making
- Nudging
- Being a role model
- Information gathering
- Information giving

# Modes of Control - Getting what you need from employees
Matrix -> CUA
Complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity                                    
new hires & people should start with low CUA tasks, with high group interest]
