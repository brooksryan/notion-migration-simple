Using 
## Customer Segment Section (Right hand – fill this out first)

1. Customer Jobs – List here the key tasks your target customers have to complete.  Think more broadly than functional jobs (e.g. eat healthily) and include social jobs (relationships) – such as looking good, fitting in or exercising power, and emotional jobs (feelings) – such as feeling safe and secure. Rank the jobs to be done by importance.

- Reduce cost of material and service partnerships necessary to build my company's products
- Build strategic partnerships that add value to the company's products
- Ensure the quality of my products  by establishing and maintaining standards for procuring services and materials
- Reduce uncertainty around my company's ability to have the requisite quantity and quality of materials in time to build products and deliver them to satisfied customers.
- Build processes for procurement that ensure supply of raw materials will meet production requirements to keep up with consumer demand
- Position themselves as  "smart," by using cutting edge technology to turn what is traditionally seen as a money pit into a competitive advantage for their company/organization

3. Customer Pains - List here the pains people experience in getting their jobs done, pain points that annoy before, during, and after trying to get a job done, including risks of bad outcomes and obstacles to getting a job done. Rank the pains by severity

- My organization is often seen simply as cost with no additional value.
- Suppliers can be difficult to deal with and often do not care about my company's needs beyond our transactional relationship
- I do not have visibility into the majority of my supplier's manufacturing or procurement processes to be able to proactively identify threats to the quality of my products.
- My organization is often blamed for being unable to prevent or react quickly to threats to production with external causes that we have little or no control over eg "black swan events"
- Many of my suppliers are technologically primitive and are unable to give me information about the continuity of their supply
- Suppliers are largely unreliable when it comes to delivering orders of materials on time and in full, disrupting my company's production plans
- Customer demand is difficult to measure, making it hard to procure the right amount of materials for production. This often means I over-purchase materials have have excess material inventory = cost lying around.

1. Customer Gains – List the gains that people require, expect or desire from getting a job done. These gains may be functional (utility), social, emotional, or financial. Rank these gains by relevance to the target segment

- I will be paid more if I do all of my jobs well.
- I will be seen as important and smart if I successfully implement visionary technology.
- Reduced uncertainty around my company's ability to have the requisite quantity and quality of materials in time to build products and deliver them to satisfied customers.
- Increased cash flow & larger margins

## Value Map Section (Left hand)

1. Pain Relievers – List here how you could alleviate specific customer pains identified in (2). Pain relievers explicitly outline how you intend to eliminate or reduce some of the things that annoy your customers before, during, or after they are trying to complete a job or that prevent them from doing so
2. Gain Creators – List here the ways you could create the customer gains identified in (3). Gain creators explicitly outline how you intend to produce outcomes and benefits that your customer expects, desires, or would be surprised by, including functional utility, social gains, positive emotions, and cost savings
3. Product(s)/Service(s) – Finally, list product or service ideas that map to the customer jobs in (1), or in the case of a single product or service innovation project, attributes and features that could help people get their most important jobs done, alleviative the most pain, and create the most gains
